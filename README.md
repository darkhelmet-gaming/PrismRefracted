**Prism (Refracted)** is a change-tracking plugin for Bukkit-based servers. Supports rollbacks, restores, previews, 
wands, and so much more. Tracking so good, the NSA stole our name.

# v3 vs v4

v4 is a ground-up rewrite and is in progress now. I have no ETA for release but please feel free to contribute. Check
out the v4 branch. v3 is the old Prism with improvements/maintenance work.

# TL;DR

I, viveleroi, created Prism ten years ago and was amazed by the community response. With the bukkit/mojang project
drama in 2014 and my waning interest in Minecraft, I moved to the Sponge project but eventually stopped all development.

In 2016 I turned the project over to another team but long story short, as I saw the game and community mature, 
and heard from so many long-time Prism users, I've decided to return to Prism.

"Prism Refracted" is my official continuation of Prism. There's a lot of work I want to do
